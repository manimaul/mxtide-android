    1. XTide 2 is Copyright (C) 1998 by David Flater, comes with
       absolutely no warranty, and is provided under the GNU General
       Public License.  See the verbose documentation for all of the
       relevant disclaimers.
    2. XTide 2 requires:
          + [4]libXpm
          + [5]libpng
          + [6]zlib (a.k.a. libz)
          + [7]libtcd
    3. You must download at least one harmonics file.  See
       [8]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#harmonicsfiles.
    4. You must set the environment variable HFILE_PATH to point to the
       harmonics files that you downloaded.  Example:

export HFILE_PATH=/usr/local/share/xtide/harmonics-free.tcd:/usr/local/share/xti
de/harmonics-nonfree.tcd

    5. ./configure; make
    6. You should now have three binaries:
          + xtide, the interactive X-windows client
          + tide, the non-interactive TTY client
          + xttpd, the web server
    7. The X-windows client is easy to use.  Go for it.
    8. tide does a few things that xtide doesn't do.  Run it with nothing
       on the command line and read the usage info.
    9. xttpd is a self-contained web server.  su root, fire it up and
       browse away.  If it doesn't run, check your logs for errors and see
       [9]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/installation.html for
       configuration help.
